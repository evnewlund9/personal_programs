Main driver program creates BusSim objects. It uses a nested for-loop to ensure that every combination of regular/express bus is simulated.
This is done for an inter-arrival rate of 60, 120, and 240 seconds and this whole process is repeated 3 times for a total of 945 simulations.
The overall statistics for each load are printed if one runs the main program.
The buses are stored in an array and each have an associated current stop. The stops are implemented in a linked-list style so that each stop points to
the stop in front of it and stop 29 points to stop 0. This was done because it creates a circular data structure that makes it easy to advance each bus to the next stop.
Each stop contains a generic queue of riders in "line".
There is also an included Statistics class that most other classes reference. This class is fairly complicated and utilizes a lot of variables but you can look at the bottom to the
statistics statement if you want to see some of the statistics being tracked.
