#### Running Unit Tests

Note:  The words in the output would not need to be exactly the same, but our testing framework requires that they match.

Exercise 11a: Calculus

+ Pass: Check that file "Quadratic.java" exists.

+ Pass: Check that a Java file compiles.

    Java file "Quadratic.java" compiles with no errors.



+ Fail: Check that the execution of your Java file matches the example

Expected output: 

```
Enter three numbers: The formula you entered is 3x^2 + 5x + 8
The derivative of the equation is 6x + 5
The anti-derivative of the equation is 1.0x^3 + 2.5x^2 + 8x


```

Your output: 

```
Enter three numbers seperated by spaces: 
The formula you entered is 3x^2 + 5x + 8
The derivative of the equation is 6x + 5
The anti-derivative of the equation is 1.0x^3 + 2.5x^2 + 8x


```

Exercise 11b: Gravity

+ Pass: Check that file "Gravity.java" exists.

+ Pass: Check that a Java file compiles.

    Java file "Gravity.java" compiles with no errors.



+ Fail: Check that the execution of your Java file matches the example

Expected output: 

```
Enter the initial position (m): Enter the initial velocity (m/s): Enter the time elapsed (s): The final position of the object is 509.5 m


```

Your output: 

```
Enter the initial position (m): 
Enter the initial velocity (m/s): 
Enter the time elapsed (s): 
The final position of the object is 1490.5m


```

Exercise 11c: Sieve of Eratosthenes

+ Pass: Check that file "Sieve.java" exists.

+ Pass: Check that a Java file compiles.

    Java file "Sieve.java" compiles with no errors.



+ Fail: Check that the execution of your Java file matches the example

**Encountered an error when running your code. Output follows:**

```
Enter an upper limit for a range of numbers: 

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 102
	at Sieve.main(Sieve.java:19)

```


+ Skip: Print solution of Sieve.java
